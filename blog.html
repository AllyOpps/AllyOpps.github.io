Every single night is pitch black outside the only light i see is from my room and the dim glow of the city in the distance.

  </p></th>
  <tr><th> <h1> 10/15/21 </h1> </th><th> <h1>i wrote something up for my bud</h1><p>(for one of my future therapists that will eventully have to read this "blog" you can skip this one)Seve lemme run you through a quick scenario. your dad walks into the room and says "hey son how's it going". You slowly start to turn around in your chair, flakes of dandruff falling off of your unkempt scalp. Your skin is cracking and dry you start to open your bloodshot eyes the gunk is falling off in chunks. You start to open your mouth revealing your teeth black and yellow from neglect your gums are receding, the stench of your breath radiates towards your father his face scrunches up a look of disgust comes over his face.  You manage to get a few words out of your withered body "I'm mining rocks in new world dad", Your father looks at you confused and mutters out "son, when do you think your gonna get out a get a job?" you adjust your posture the whole house rumbles. you sit up a little and your back creaks you look your dad dead in the eyes and say "papa this is my work, this is my job, this is my life". Your father reaches into his pocket and pulls out a freshly polished M1911 with a mirror shine your whole den is reflected in the guns beautiful slide, you can even see the half-eaten bag of bar-b-q fritos spilling out on the dank soda soaked crumb covered floor. He cocks the hammer and slowly starts to move the gun up, millions of thoughts rush through your head. He raises the gun, it slowly passes by your head he puts the gun to his temple and looks you dead in the eyes. His old fingers slowly reach towards the trigger, you try and blurt something out before he pulls the trigger. Your too slow, his body falls. the first thing you notice is the bloodstain on the wall slowly dripping towards the empty diet coke bottle you had as a doorstop. Your eyes move over to the body, you're in shock, you disgusted. Then it hits you, this is all your fault if only you didn't play new world. This will be your life in 2 years.
