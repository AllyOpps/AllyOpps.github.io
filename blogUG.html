<tr><th> <h1> 9/15/22 </h1> </th><th> <h1>Jeff gone</h1><p>I really dont know if this was a good move but being with him was having a major effect on my mental health. i just wasnt happy when i was around him, i wish i could have maybe seen a good side but it was just always so negative around him. couldnt handle it. so now what... I dont really know what the next move for the opps is might starting to to a therapist or the other one whichever can get me crazy schizo femboy drugs. ya know or like start hrt eventully if i ever actully get a fucking job and stop being such a damn lameo... im only 19 and i already feel so lost in life, big stinky. This is just me ranting about random shit now but i guess thats like the point to having a blog even if i get like 2 viewers a week :P good place to vent.

<tr><th> <h1> 9/21/21 </h1> </th><th> <h1>(this prob sounds like the ramblings of a madman feel free to skip reading this)</h1><p>Ok ok ok, hear me out the fact that every like match up(con vs lib, NDP vs bloc and green vs people) is the opposite of what it would have been if we had a popular vote is a problem. don't get me wrong I understand the current system but this has to make sense to somebody else that the fact that the NDP got DOUBLE the votes of the Bloc but has 8 fewer seats is a problem. or that the people's party got 5% of the vote share but 0 seats while the green party only got 2.3% and managed 2 seats. other than that let's talk about the results lib minority gov, nothing is going to get done with a minority government because all of the conservative accidents are just gonna vote against the lib gov and I understand that's how the system works but at this point why does it even matter the lib gov might pass one or two bills that screw Alberta but that's about all that's gonna happen in the next 4 years. I don't know how to think about this but it feels like nothing is going to change for a while :/ </p></th>
